                <p>Easily convert Minecraft schematics to Bloxd.io schematics( and vice versa?).</p>
                <p>By RealSlothuLT3 :D</p>

                <p>
                <strong>Supported types:</strong>
                .bloxdschem, .schematic, .schem, .litematic
            </p>
            <p>Blocks with no equivalent are replaced with dirt.</p>
            <p>Minecraft Schematics that exceed Bloxd.io's schematic chunk limit (100 chunks) get split into multiple files, compressed into a single .zip file.</p>
            <p>The X-Coordinate specified at the end each file name represents the amount of blocks the build has to be moved on the X-Axis, compared to the position of the first schematic.</p>
            <p>The Y- and Z-Coordinates stay the same.</p>
            <p>Credits to hansdiewurst for part of the schematic converting logic.</p>
            <p>⚠️ Only Minecraft schematics are supported! Minecraft maps are not supported! To convert Minecraft maps to schematics, follow <a href="https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?t=6007" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>. Ignore the step for WorldEdit if you already have the map. ⚠️</p>
