Minecraft to Bloxd.io schematic converter
=========================================

Easily convert Minecraft schematics to Bloxd.io schematics( and vice versa?).

By RealSlothuLT3 :D

**Supported types:** .bloxdschem, .schematic, .schem, .litematic

Blocks with no equivalent are replaced with dirt.

Minecraft Schematics that exceed Bloxd.io's schematic chunk limit (100 chunks) get split into multiple files, compressed into a single .zip file.

The X-Coordinate specified at the end each file name represents the amount of blocks the build has to be moved on the X-Axis, compared to the position of the first schematic.

The Y- and Z-Coordinates stay the same.

⚠️ Only Minecraft schematics are supported! Minecraft maps are not supported! To convert Minecraft maps to schematics, follow [this tutorial](https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?t=6007). Ignore the step for WorldEdit if you already have the map. ⚠️
